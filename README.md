# POSE-ESTIMINATION-OF-GYM-WORKOUT-USING-YOLOV7

# Aim:
Human Pose Estimation is a computer vision-based technology that identifies and classifies specific points on the human body.These points represent our limbs and joints to calculate the angle of flexion, and estimate, well, human pose.
# About:
Position estimation is a computer vision technique that predicts and tracks not only the location of a person or object but the joints specifically. Remarkable progress has been made in posture estimation
so far, but still recognizing human activities in real-life settings remains unsettled. This task becomes even more challenging when approaching this not from standalone cameras in offline mode, but from 
smartphones in real-time. This happens because real-time execution significantly raises input data through put and computations needed, while mobile devices are still limited in available computational
resources.

# Results of the "POSE-ESTIMINATION-OF-GYM-WORKOUT-USING-YOLOV7" Project:

In conclusion, gym pose estimation technology has emerged as a valuable tool in the fitness industry, offering numerous benefits for both individuals and fitness professionals. This technology utilizes computer vision algorithms and deep learning techniques to accurately track and analyze human movement during exercise routines. One key advantage of gym pose estimation is its ability to provide real-time feedback and guidance to users. By tracking the body's position and alignment, it can identify errors in form or technique, helping individuals to correct their posture and reduce the risk of injury. This instant feedback can enhance the effectiveness of workouts and contribute to better overall results. Moreover, gym pose estimation allows for precise tracking of various exercises and movements. It can recognize and differentiate between different poses, such as squats, lunges, push-ups, or yoga asanas. This versatility makes it a useful tool for a wide range of fitness activities and training programs.
